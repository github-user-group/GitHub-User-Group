18:45 - 19:15 - Dev Productivity – Becoming a 10x Engineer in the GenAI Era by [Naor Peled](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naorpeled/)

Naor Peled is a software engineer at Empathy, open-source maintainer, and AI enthusiast. He’s passionate about developer productivity, infrastructure, and building tools that scale. Outside of work, he contributes to projects like TypeORM and Cyphernetes, and regularly speaks about the intersection of AI and software engineering.

What does it really mean to be a “10x engineer” in a world where AI can write code, explain errors, and generate entire features?

In this talk, we’ll explore how GenAI is changing the way we think about developer productivity. We’ll look at how AI tools can help you move faster, learn new things quickly, and level up your workflow, but also why that’s only part of the picture.

19:15 - 19:45 - Code Review in the Age of GenAI: Confidence at Scale by [Itamar Friedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itamarf/)

Itamar Friedman is the CEO and co-founder of Qodo, the leader in the emerging code integrity space.
Prior to that, Itamar was the co-founder and CTO of Visualead, acquired by Alibaba Group. As a director at Alibaba, he led teams to create innovative ML-based B2C and B2D applications and tools used by millions.
Itamar holds a BSc & MSc in Electrical Engineering (Summa Cum Laude) from the Technion, majoring in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

As AI coding assistants and copilots increasingly generate large portions of our codebases, the question is no longer if AI will write code, but how we ensure its quality.
This talk focuses on the emerging landscape of AI-assisted code reviews. We’ll explore where traditional review processes bottleneck , and how AI tools enable automated, explainable, and high quality code reviews at scale.
We’ll also highlight key open-source tools and best practices that help developers maintain control, enforce standards, and build trust in AI-written code—turning AI from a code generator into a true engineering partner.

18:45 - 19:15 - GitHub Next & the future of software development by Idan Gazit

AI has already caused a revolution in software development with Copilot, but we’re only at the start of this cycle. What does that mean? Where do we believe that it’s going? And how does a team like GitHub Next think about exploring that future?

Idan Gazit leads GitHub Next, the birthplace of GitHub Copilot, and many more prototypes that explore how AI will make software development faster, easier, safer, and more accessible for developers everywhere.
As a hybrid designer and developer, his interests span a variety of fields. Idan is keenly interested in data display issues, typography, and color. You're likely to hear him talk about the pit of success, and the importance of good nouns.
Idan was previously a principal engineer at Heroku, and is an alumnus of the Django web framework's core development team.
He is a firm believer in the power of web technologies, and is most at home in them, though many evenings you can find him soldering a new keyboard or muttering foul language while trying to get Rust to run on a microcontroller.


19:15 - 19:45 - Q&A with Idan

Join us for a Q&A session with Idan, where you will have the chance to engage directly with a pioneering technologist shaping the future of software development.
This interactive segment provides a unique platform for developers, technologists, and industry professionals to delve deeper into the transformative potential of AI in software engineering and explore the state of software development tools.
This Q&A is designed to be an engaging, thought-provoking dialogue that goes beyond surface-level discussions, offering attendees a rare glimpse into the strategic thinking driving technological innovation at GitHub Next.

Topics open for exploration:

* The evolution of AI tools in software development
* Emerging trends in developer productivity
* Challenges of integrating AI into existing development ecosystems
* Future vision for AI-assisted coding and software engineering
