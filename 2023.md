18:45 - 19:15 - DevOps 2.0: Continuous Merge by Yishai Beeri (CTO @ LinearB)

When DevOps first started to manifest over a decade ago, a lot of the focus was on streamlining engineering, much in the same way as assembly lines. Starting with the most repetitive and automate-able processes, we created pipelines for continuous operations‚Äì‚Äìtesting, integration and deployment (AKA CI/CD). Concepts were borrowed from Kaizen (Japanese assembly lines) to ensure these processes flowed and worked, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine ever going back on the process and quality improvements brought on by CI/CD. But it only got us so far.

After solving for automation of programs - tests, integrations, builds and deploys are all basically scripts - our attention can turn to much heavier sources of friction, which are also harder to automate. These are the touch points between humans: pickup time for code reviews, who do I even assign this review to?!, what do I need to line up to get this PR merged? And between humans and programs: flaky builds and tests, builds + tests that take too long, post-deployment ownership during outages, synchronizing access to dev environments, and much more.

Enter the next phase of the DevOps evolution. To continue streamlining our engineering operations, we need to rethink our processes and eliminate the amounting friction. In this talk we‚Äôll bring data and research from millions of PRs and developers, and share how simple tweaks have unlocked velocity that is faster by orders of magnitude. Everything from automating trivial code fixes, better understanding of ownership and stakeholders in the process, improved communication (the backbone of DevOps!) all map to greater velocity and developer happiness‚Äìand you can too! Join us to learn how.

19:15 - 19:45 - Git Decentralized by Costa Shapiro (Costa @ Costa works consultancy)


How much work in your flow?
Do we always need GitHub (and its PR functionality)?
How work with Git, without Hub will look like?
Do you need "self server"?
Why can you take bikes on trains and not vice versa?

These questions will attempt to be given answers
in a barebone-git-refreshing presentation that
-- warning -- may make you think, reconsider your
default team workflows, and demand a hands-on
demonstration afterwards.

18:45 - 19:15 - Tracing the Open Source Revolution by Tomer Brisker (Principal Software Engineer & Tech Lead @ Red Hat)

Everyone in the software development world today has at least heard about Open Source, but this wasn't always the case. Where did Open Source come from? What are the ideas behind it? What are the differences between the various licenses? How can some companies profit from Open Source if the software can be copied and changed freely? And, most importantly - why should you care about it?

18:45 - 19:15 - How One Code Contribution Changed My Career by Ran Isenberg (Principal Software Architect @ CyberArk)

On October 2nd, 2020, my first pull request to an open-source project was merged. Little did I know that it would lead to my promotion to System Architect and that I'd talk about it at the AWS TLV Summit in Israel.

In this talk, I share my journey in the open-source world and how it improved my engineering skills, led to my promotion at work, and introduced new opportunities in public speaking, podcast appearances, and blog writing. I will discuss soft skills and behaviors that allowed me to advance my career and share tips and tricks for new code contributions while keeping a work-life balance so you can start your journey.

19:15 - 19:45 - Open-Source Project as a Personal Growth Engine by Lior Yardeni (Backend Developer @ LSEG) & Pavel Zagalsky (Backend Engineer @ Intel)

We will present our open source project, a simplified system to deploy and manage multi-cloud assets and their costs, and we will also share the added value we gained through the development process, from skills sharpening to a full-on career change.

18:45 - 19:15 - Efficient Code Reviews with CodeQL by Uriel Yair (Application Security Tech Lead @ Comsec)

Let‚Äôs talk about code reviews, no, not those you are so used to (and exhausted from..). There are other kinds, the one that drives developers nuts from getting them to heaven‚Ä¶ I mean production.

I want to introduce the security-oriented code review and how we can speed up the process with a bit of the help of CodeQL.

In this talk we‚Äôll speak about CodeQL, what it does, why is it here in the first place, and why companies really need it. We‚Äôll try to understand if we can save some of our costs on the application security team because we have another pair of eyes that watch over our codebase so we might miss a few spots here and there. At last, we will see how to use CodeQL in our GitHub repository.

19:15 - 19:45 - Unpacking GitHub Copilot: Advanced Tricks by Eyar Zilberman (CPO @ Datree)

We already know that GitHub copilot is super cool, and you have even had it installed on your IDE, but are you sure you're leveraging its full capabilities to write better (and faster) code?

In this session, we will review some advanced usage of Copilot, and we will deep dive into how to customize it to your needs. We will also discuss the downsides of the tool and how to make sure copilot will not replace us all as developers in the future ;)

18:45 - 19:15 - Drunken Idea Leads to Wild ML Adventure By Liza Katz (Software Engineer)

The story begins with a night of excessive drinking in great company, as many great stories do. An interesting and provocative idea grabbed my attention. Weeks have passed, and I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided to give it a shot.
This talk tells the story of my journey pursuing that idea into the ML realm: full of twists and turns, late night debugging sessions, kind and helpful people, technical challenges, frustrations, and many many photos I'll never be able to forget.

19:15 - 19:45 - ML-Ops: The Quest for Full-Blown Source Control By Itai Admi (Team Leader @ Treeverse)

As the industry slowly progresses towards full-blown ML-Ops platforms - implement design, model development and operation of machine learning. Automating data science operation with CI/CD has many requirements that as an industry we almost solved. For example Feature Store with Tekton, ML Metadata Store with Neptune, and ML Flow orchestrator with Kubeflow. Having said that, we are still missing the piece of full blown source control. Which includes, version control for Code, Data, and ML Model artifacts. Using Github we can version control our code and ML artifacts pretty easily. When trying to version our data, we hit the wall of scalability and security. Our next challenge in tracking the ML-Ops journey is understanding how to fully version control our data and connect it with the rest of the machine learning automation efforts. In this session, you will learn how to track your MLOps journey, the tools that proved themselves in the industry and take full advantage of OSS tools for versioning your data.
