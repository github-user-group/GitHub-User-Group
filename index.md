18:45 - 19:15 - From Traditional AppSec Tools to AI-Powered Reviews: Building a Modern DevSecOps Workflow by [Ariel Beck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-beck-84b44b28/) & [Meshi Yona](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meshi-yona-735826112/)

Traditional AppSec toolchains often feel like a patchwork of tools‚Äîeach with its own setup, maintenance, and integration challenges. They can slow down development, overwhelm teams with alerts, and still leave gaps in security coverage.

In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how to set up a comprehensive DevSecOps chain using GitHub Actions integrated with best-in-class open-source tools for SAST, secrets detection, SCA, and DAST. Then, we‚Äôll show how you can rethink this workflow using an AI agent powered by AWS Bedrock and Claude to review code, streamline processes, and deliver actionable insights.

Through a live demo, you‚Äôll see both approaches in action and learn how to overcome common pitfalls in building secure pipelines. By the end, you‚Äôll gain practical knowledge to enhance your security practices, reduce friction in your workflows, and adopt modern tools with confidence. Whether you're a developer, security professional, or DevOps enthusiast, this talk will help you take your DevSecOps to the next level.

19:15 - 19:45 - Automating Database Testing and Monitoring in Your CI/CD Pipeline by [Ben Greenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hummusonrails/)

[slides](https://noti.st/benhayehudi/vqu6Et/automating-database-testing-in-your-ci-cd-pipelines)

This talk will guide you through the essentials of integrating comprehensive database testing and monitoring into your CI/CD pipelines. We'll explore the types of tests you should run, from unit to performance tests, and demonstrate how to automate these processes using GitHub Actions. Testing databases involves unique challenges such as ensuring data consistency, handling stateful interactions, and dealing with various concurrency issues. We'll also touch upon and briefly show how to share your GitHub Actions workflow data with monitoring tools like Prometheus, and what aspects of your workflow data you should share to maintain a healthy and performant database. Join us to learn how to elevate your CI/CD workflows and achieve more holistic database management.
