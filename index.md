18:45 - 19:15 - GitHub Next & the future of software development by Idan Gazit

AI has already caused a revolution in software development with Copilot, but we‚Äôre only at the start of this cycle. What does that mean? Where do we believe that it‚Äôs going? And how does a team like GitHub Next think about exploring that future?

Idan Gazit leads GitHub Next, the birthplace of GitHub Copilot, and many more prototypes that explore how AI will make software development faster, easier, safer, and more accessible for developers everywhere.
As a hybrid designer and developer, his interests span a variety of fields. Idan is keenly interested in data display issues, typography, and color. You're likely to hear him talk about the pit of success, and the importance of good nouns.
Idan was previously a principal engineer at Heroku, and is an alumnus of the Django web framework's core development team.
He is a firm believer in the power of web technologies, and is most at home in them, though many evenings you can find him soldering a new keyboard or muttering foul language while trying to get Rust to run on a microcontroller.


19:15 - 19:45 - Q&A with Idan

Join us for a Q&A session with Idan, where you will have the chance to engage directly with a pioneering technologist shaping the future of software development.
This interactive segment provides a unique platform for developers, technologists, and industry professionals to delve deeper into the transformative potential of AI in software engineering and explore the state of software development tools.
This Q&A is designed to be an engaging, thought-provoking dialogue that goes beyond surface-level discussions, offering attendees a rare glimpse into the strategic thinking driving technological innovation at GitHub Next.

Topics open for exploration:

* The evolution of AI tools in software development
* Emerging trends in developer productivity
* Challenges of integrating AI into existing development ecosystems
* Future vision for AI-assisted coding and software engineering
