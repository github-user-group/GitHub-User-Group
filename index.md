18:30 - 18:45 - Introduction & Community updates

18:45 - 19:15 - Turning a One-Off Fix into Org-Wide Automation by [Rotem Gani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rotem-gani-b58abaa4/) / [Efi Merdler-Kravitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efime/) / [Chen Amrani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chen-amrani-450309234/)

Every engineering team has that moment - a repetitive, error-prone change that needs to be applied across dozens of repositories. Everyone knows it should be automated - but somehow it never is.

This talk tells the real story of how one such "annoying but necessary" fix evolved into a fully-fledged Github Copilot Agent powered automation platform used across our organization.

19:15 - 19:45 - Decouple Your Decoupling: Level-up your GitHub workflows by [Tom Brovender](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-brovender/)

GitHub Actions has made it easy to automate almost anything, but building CI/CD that truly scales across many repositories and teams is still hard. As projects grow, pipelines tend to become tightly tied to specific repos, environments, and assumptions, which makes change slower and harder than it should be.
In this talk, I’ll share how to think about GitHub Actions in a more modular way, so teams can move faster without stepping on each other. You’ll see how small design choices in your workflows can make a big difference in how easy your CI/CD is to grow, maintain, and trust over time.
