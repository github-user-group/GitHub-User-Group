18:45 - 19:15 - From Traditional AppSec Tools to AI-Powered Reviews: Building a Modern DevSecOps Workflow by Ariel Beck & Meshi Yona

Traditional AppSec toolchains often feel like a patchwork of tools‚Äîeach with its own setup, maintenance, and integration challenges. They can slow down development, overwhelm teams with alerts, and still leave gaps in security coverage.

In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how to set up a comprehensive DevSecOps chain using GitHub Actions integrated with best-in-class open-source tools for SAST, secrets detection, SCA, and DAST. Then, we‚Äôll show how you can rethink this workflow using an AI agent powered by AWS Bedrock and Claude to review code, streamline processes, and deliver actionable insights.

Through a live demo, you‚Äôll see both approaches in action and learn how to overcome common pitfalls in building secure pipelines. By the end, you‚Äôll gain practical knowledge to enhance your security practices, reduce friction in your workflows, and adopt modern tools with confidence. Whether you're a developer, security professional, or DevOps enthusiast, this talk will help you take your DevSecOps to the next level.

19:15 - 19:45 - Automating Database Testing and Monitoring in Your CI/CD Pipeline by Ben Greenberg

This talk will guide you through the essentials of integrating comprehensive database testing and monitoring into your CI/CD pipelines. We'll explore the types of tests you should run, from unit to performance tests, and demonstrate how to automate these processes using GitHub Actions. Testing databases involves unique challenges such as ensuring data consistency, handling stateful interactions, and dealing with various concurrency issues. We'll also touch upon and briefly show how to share your GitHub Actions workflow data with monitoring tools like Prometheus, and what aspects of your workflow data you should share to maintain a healthy and performant database. Join us to learn how to elevate your CI/CD workflows and achieve more holistic database management.

18:45 - 19:15 - Cracking the Code: A Deep Dive into Automated Testing Strategies by Benny Daon (Founder @ Terminal7)

In the world of software, it is crucial to have automated testing processes the catch as many bugs as possible. This presentation will delve into the do's and don'ts of automated software testing, using a real-world example to illustrate a state-of-the-art tool chest, best practices and pitfalls to avoid.

The speaker, an experienced programmer, will share their valuable insights and expertise gained from years of working of designing, architecting and programming test automation infrastructure.

19:15 - 19:45 - Docu-mentality: The Art of Crafting Effective External Documentation by Hadar Cohen (Developer Advocate @ Port)

We all write documentation! Discover the importance of external documentation in modern software. This presentation delves into how effective documentation enhances usability, encourages engagement, and makes users like your product.

We will explore various examples of common mistakes and understand how to avoid them. I will share what I believe are good practices to use when writing any documentation, along with some useful tools. You will get some practical tips to use the next time you write about your new feature. Gain insights to use documentation to create a bridge between developers, users, and successful software projects.

18:45 - 19:15 - DevOps 2.0: Continuous Merge by Yishai Beeri (CTO @ LinearB)

When DevOps first started to manifest over a decade ago, a lot of the focus was on streamlining engineering, much in the same way as assembly lines. Starting with the most repetitive and automate-able processes, we created pipelines for continuous operations‚Äì‚Äìtesting, integration and deployment (AKA CI/CD). Concepts were borrowed from Kaizen (Japanese assembly lines) to ensure these processes flowed and worked, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine ever going back on the process and quality improvements brought on by CI/CD. But it only got us so far.

After solving for automation of programs - tests, integrations, builds and deploys are all basically scripts - our attention can turn to much heavier sources of friction, which are also harder to automate. These are the touch points between humans: pickup time for code reviews, who do I even assign this review to?!, what do I need to line up to get this PR merged? And between humans and programs: flaky builds and tests, builds + tests that take too long, post-deployment ownership during outages, synchronizing access to dev environments, and much more.

Enter the next phase of the DevOps evolution. To continue streamlining our engineering operations, we need to rethink our processes and eliminate the amounting friction. In this talk we‚Äôll bring data and research from millions of PRs and developers, and share how simple tweaks have unlocked velocity that is faster by orders of magnitude. Everything from automating trivial code fixes, better understanding of ownership and stakeholders in the process, improved communication (the backbone of DevOps!) all map to greater velocity and developer happiness‚Äìand you can too! Join us to learn how.

19:15 - 19:45 - Git Decentralized by Costa Shapiro (Costa @ Costa works consultancy)


How much work in your flow?
Do we always need GitHub (and its PR functionality)?
How work with Git, without Hub will look like?
Do you need "self server"?
Why can you take bikes on trains and not vice versa?

These questions will attempt to be given answers
in a barebone-git-refreshing presentation that
-- warning -- may make you think, reconsider your
default team workflows, and demand a hands-on
demonstration afterwards.
